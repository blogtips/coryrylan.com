Below is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmEvKLYF0os" target="_blank">screencast</a> of an introduction to <a href="http://reactivex.io/" target="_blank">RxJS</a> Observables and 
how they integrate into <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular 2</a>. First we will cover what Observables are and how RxJS helps us.
Next we will learn how to use Observable Operators and create a Counter UI widget without Angular. Afterwards we will create a small Angular 2 app to
search the YouTube API using Observables.

You can find the source code by clicking the `demo` button below. Please feel free to leave feedback
in the comments below. At the time of this recording Angular 2 is at Beta 6. Afterwards check out my other post on <a href="/blog/angular-2-observable-data-services">Angular 2 Observable Data Services</a>.
