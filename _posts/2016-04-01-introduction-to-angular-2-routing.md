Angular 2 brings many improved modules to the Angular ecosystem incluing a new router called the Component router. The component router 
is a highly configurable and feature packed router. Features included are routing, nested routes, named routes, route parameters and auxillary routes. 
This post we will cover basic routing, route parameters and nested child routes. With these basics we can build a complex application that is easy to 
reason about.
