2015 has been a great and busy year for me. I have had the chance to help work and teach as a instructor
for a internship. I also had the great opportunity to help manage a large web project. This year I've been heavily focused
on the font end of web development and plan on continuing while deep diving into Angular 2.

Just wanted to say thank you for all who took the time to read my blog. I hope to continue to provide useful posts in the
future!

##Google Analytics

I just wanted to share how much my blog has grown this past year. Here are some stats from Google Analytics.

<code>

<h3>2015</h3>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
